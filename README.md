LawDigger
=========

Github for the legal world (at least, that was the idea).

The stack: MongoDB, Python, AngularJS, Zurb/Compass.

This project is tentatively abandoned.

The goal was to provide pleasant, Github-esque browsing of statutory changes over time.

The law-parsing logic is based on a series of regular expressions tailored to each body of law.

I got bogged down when trying to fine-tune these regexes to account for all the inconsistencies in the statutes' formatting.

Ultimately, due to the number of those inconsistencies, I decided that I could not guarantee the accuracy that legal professionals would require when reading the law.

(Plus, it just became a huge headache.)
