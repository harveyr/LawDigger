LawDigger
=========

Github for the legal world (at least, that was the idea).

The stack: MongoDB, Python, AngularJS, Zurb/Compass.

This project is tentatively abandoned.

The goal was to provide pleasant, Github-esque browsing of statutory changes over time.

The law-parsing logic is based on a series of regular expressions tailored to each body of law.

Though I met with some initial success while testing and presenting the first few chapters of Oregon Revised Statutes, I got bogged down when trying to fine-tune the regexes to account for all the inconsistencies in the subsequent chapters' formatting.

Ultimately, due to the number of those inconsistencies, I decided that I could not guarantee the accuracy that legal professionals would require when reading the law.

(Plus, it just became a huge headache.)
